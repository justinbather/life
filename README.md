# Life - Track workouts, meals, and thoughts, all from the terminal
> Basically, I didn't want to write js

## Structure

- life-server/
> Contains the server, obviously

- life-cli/
> Contains the CLI, clearly

Not Priority

## MVP
- Can upload workouts to something like /v1/workouts/outdoor-run/
- Can fetch workout data by date, incl range

- Can upload meals storing cals and macros
- Can fetch data by date or aggregate/range

## Future
- Upload some sort of score for the day based on how you feel
- Generate a monthly or weekly report of everything
- Reminders to do this stuff
